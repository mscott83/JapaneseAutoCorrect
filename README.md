# JapaneseAutoCorrect

Adds common WW2-era names and words to the Microsoft Word auto-correct dictionary. Adds "macrons" (ō, ū) to common English translations of Japanese words.

Usage: in Word, type the name without the diacritic marks, and autocorrect will correct the word to have the correct capitalisation with the diacritic marks. So type "shokaku" and the word will be autocorrected to "Shōkaku".

Primarily focusses on the following types:

- Ship names (Sōryū, Hiryū etc)
- Places
- Names (Chūichi Nagumo)

...with more to be added.
